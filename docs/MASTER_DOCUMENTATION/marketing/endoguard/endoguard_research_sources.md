## Summary: Key Research Themes for EndoGuard™

### PCOS and Environmental Factors
The research consistently demonstrates that PCOS is not purely genetic but significantly influenced by environmental exposures including EDCs in food packaging, personal care products, and household items. Diet quality, plastic tableware usage, and exposure to environmental toxins are modifiable risk factors that EndoGuard™ can help users identify and address.

### Thyroid Disorders and Chemical Exposures
Multiple high-quality studies establish clear links between EDC exposure and thyroid dysfunction, including both hypo/hyperthyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease. Chemicals of particular concern include triclosan (in antibacterial products), BPA, phthalates, and air pollutants. EndoGuard™'s EDC exposure assessment directly addresses this critical knowledge gap.

### Menopause and Evolving HRT Guidance
Recent research and regulatory updates (2024-2025) reflect a significant shift in understanding of HRT safety and efficacy. For women within 10 years of menopause onset, HRT shows benefits for symptom management and potentially cardiovascular health. EndoGuard™ can help women and providers make informed, personalized decisions about HRT by considering individual risk factors, environmental exposures, and current evidence.

### Cross-Cutting Themes
1. **Environmental exposures are modifiable risk factors** for hormone health
2. **Personalized medicine approach** is essential given individual variation in exposures and responses
3. **Evidence-based decision support** is needed to counter misinformation and outdated guidance
4. **Integration of environmental health** into clinical endocrinology is overdue and critical

These research findings validate EndoGuard™'s core value proposition: providing evidence-based, personalized hormone health intelligence that integrates environmental factors into clinical decision-making.
