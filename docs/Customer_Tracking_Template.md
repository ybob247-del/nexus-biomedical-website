3. When they become a customer, add to **Sheet 1: Customer List**
4. Add their features to the appropriate product sheet (Sheets 2-7)

### When enabling features manually:
1. Go to the product sheet (e.g., Sheet 2 for RxGuard™)
2. Check the boxes for features they paid for
3. Note the "Enabled Date"
4. Add any special notes (integrations, custom requests)

### Monthly review:
1. Check **Sheet 1** for upcoming renewals
2. Review **Sheet 8** for stalled deals
3. Update status for any changes

## Tips:

- **Color code** rows by status (green = active, yellow = trial, red = churned)
- **Use data validation** for dropdown menus (Status, Plan, etc.)
- **Set up email reminders** for trial expirations and renewals
- **Share with team** (if you have one) with appropriate permissions
- **Export weekly** as backup

This template will work for your first 5-10 customers. After that, we'll build a proper admin panel!
