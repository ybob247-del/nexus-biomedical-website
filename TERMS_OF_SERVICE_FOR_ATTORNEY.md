## 7. HIPAA and Healthcare Privacy

### Understanding HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law that protects the privacy and security of medical information held by **covered entities**, which are defined as:

1. **Healthcare Providers** who transmit health information electronically in connection with certain transactions
2. **Health Plans** (insurance companies, HMOs, Medicare, Medicaid)
3. **Healthcare Clearinghouses** that process health information between providers and payers

### Our HIPAA Status

**Nexus Biomedical Intelligence is not a HIPAA-covered entity.**

We do not fall into any of the three categories defined by HIPAA because:

- We do not provide medical treatment, diagnosis, or prescriptions
- We are not a health insurance plan or payer
- We do not process insurance claims or operate as a clearinghouse
- We do not transmit protected health information (PHI) on behalf of healthcare providers
- We do not access or integrate with electronic health records (EHRs) or medical record systems

### Implications for Healthcare Providers

**If you are a healthcare provider:**

- Using our Services **does not create HIPAA liability** for your practice
- You **do not need a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with us
- Our Services operate independently of your patient records and do not access PHI from your practice
- If you choose to enter patient information into our platforms, you are responsible for de-identifying that information and ensuring compliance with your own HIPAA obligations

**We recommend using our tools for educational purposes or with anonymized/de-identified data only.**

### Data We Collect

We collect only information that users voluntarily provide through our assessment tools, including:

- Email address and account information
- Self-reported symptoms and health information
- Medication names entered for interaction checking
- Assessment responses and results

We do NOT collect:

- Patient names or medical record numbers
- Social Security numbers
- Insurance policy numbers
- Medical records from healthcare providers
- Diagnostic codes or treatment records from clinical systems
