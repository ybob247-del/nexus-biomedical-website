## HIPAA and Healthcare Privacy

### Understanding HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law that protects the privacy and security of medical information held by **covered entities**. Under HIPAA, covered entities are defined as:

1. **Healthcare Providers** who transmit health information electronically in connection with certain transactions (such as billing)
2. **Health Plans** (insurance companies, HMOs, Medicare, Medicaid)
3. **Healthcare Clearinghouses** that process health information between providers and payers

### Our HIPAA Status

**Nexus Biomedical Intelligence is not a HIPAA-covered entity.** We do not fall into any of the three categories defined by HIPAA because:

- We do not provide medical treatment, diagnosis, or prescriptions
- We are not a health insurance plan or payer
- We do not process insurance claims or operate as a clearinghouse
- We do not transmit protected health information (PHI) on behalf of healthcare providers
- We do not access or integrate with electronic health records (EHRs) or medical record systems

### What This Means for Healthcare Providers

**If you are a healthcare provider using our Services:**

- Using our platforms **does not create HIPAA liability** for your practice
- You **do not need a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with us
- Our Services operate independently of your patient records and do not access PHI from your practice
- We collect only information that users voluntarily enter directly into our assessment tools

**Important:** If you choose to enter patient information into our platforms, you are responsible for de-identifying that information and ensuring compliance with your own HIPAA obligations. We recommend using our tools for educational purposes or with anonymized/de-identified data only.

### What This Means for Individual Users

While HIPAA does not apply to our Services, we are committed to protecting your privacy through:

- **Industry-standard encryption** for data transmission and storage
- **Secure access controls** to prevent unauthorized access
- **Regular security audits** and updates
- **Strict internal policies** limiting employee access to your data
- **No sale of your personal health data** to third parties for marketing purposes

We collect only the information you voluntarily provide through our assessment tools. We do not collect protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII) such as:
- Patient names or medical record numbers
- Social Security numbers
- Insurance policy numbers
- Medical records from healthcare providers
- Diagnostic codes or treatment records from clinical systems

---

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including:

- **Encryption:** All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols
- **Secure Storage:** Data is stored on secure servers with encryption at rest
- **Access Controls:** Strict authentication and authorization controls limit access to your data
- **Regular Audits:** We conduct security assessments and vulnerability testing
- **Employee Training:** Our team is trained on data protection and privacy best practices

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**Access:** You can request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.

## Data Retention
