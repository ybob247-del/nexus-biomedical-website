## Patient Quick Start Guide

### Welcome to EndoGuard™!

Thank you for taking the first step toward understanding and optimizing your hormone health. This quick start guide will help you get the most out of EndoGuard™ in just a few simple steps.

---

### Step 1: Complete Your Assessments

The foundation of your EndoGuard™ experience is your comprehensive assessment. This includes two parts: the **Symptom Assessment** and the **EDC Exposure Assessment**.

**Symptom Assessment** helps us understand what you're experiencing. You'll answer questions about your energy levels, mood, sleep, menstrual cycles (if applicable), weight changes, and more. Be thorough and honest—the more accurate your responses, the better your results will be. This typically takes about 10-15 minutes.

**EDC Exposure Assessment** evaluates your daily exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. You'll tell us about the products you use (personal care, household cleaners), how you store food, your diet, and your environment. Think through your daily routines from morning to night to capture all exposures. This also takes about 10-15 minutes.

**Pro Tip:** Set aside 30-45 minutes in a quiet space to complete both assessments without interruption. You can save your progress and come back anytime, but completing it in one session gives you the best experience.

---

### Step 2: Review Your Results

Once you've completed your assessments, our AI will analyze your responses and generate your personalized results. Here's what you'll see:

**Symptom Map** shows which hormone pathways may be affected based on your symptoms. You'll see visual connections between your symptoms and specific hormones (like estrogen, testosterone, thyroid hormones, cortisol). Click on any pathway to learn more about how it works and what it regulates.

**EDC Exposure Dashboard** displays your risk scores for different categories of endocrine disruptors (BPA, phthalates, parabens, PFAS, etc.). Red indicates high exposure—these are your priorities. Yellow is moderate, and green is low. You'll also see exactly where these exposures are coming from (specific products, habits, environmental factors).

**Personalized Hormone Health Roadmap** is your action plan. We've prioritized evidence-based recommendations based on your unique symptoms and exposures. Each recommendation includes the research behind it, how to implement it, and what results to expect.

**Pro Tip:** Don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of information. Focus on the top 3-5 recommendations to start. Small, consistent changes add up to big results.

---

### Step 3: Take Action

Now it's time to implement your roadmap. Here's how to approach it:

**Start with Quick Wins.** Product swaps and dietary changes often have the fastest impact and are easiest to implement. For example, switching from plastic to glass food containers, choosing fragrance-free personal care products, or adding cruciferous vegetables to your diet.

**Track Your Progress.** Use the daily or weekly symptom tracker to log how you're feeling. This helps you see patterns and measure what's working. You can also track which interventions you've implemented and when.

**Be Patient.** Hormone changes take time. Most users see noticeable improvements within 30-90 days of consistent implementation. Don't expect overnight results, but do expect steady progress.

**Adjust as Needed.** Your roadmap is dynamic. As you make progress, you can re-assess and get updated recommendations. If something isn't working or isn't feasible, try a different approach.

**Pro Tip:** Set phone reminders to track your symptoms consistently. Data-driven insights are only possible with regular tracking.

---

### Step 4: Work with Your Healthcare Provider

EndoGuard™ is designed to complement, not replace, medical care. Here's how to use it with your healthcare provider:

**Share Your Report.** Export your comprehensive assessment as a PDF and bring it to your next appointment. Many providers find EndoGuard™ reports helpful for understanding patient concerns and guiding treatment decisions.

**Ask Informed Questions.** Use the evidence links in your roadmap to discuss specific interventions with your provider. For example, "I saw research suggesting that reducing BPA exposure can improve PCOS symptoms. What do you think about switching to glass food containers?"

**Request Relevant Testing.** Your symptom map can guide which hormone tests to request. If your map shows potential thyroid dysfunction, ask your provider about TSH, Free T3, Free T4, and thyroid antibody testing.

**Communicate Openly.** Let your provider know you're using EndoGuard™ and how it's helping you. Most providers appreciate data-driven patients who are actively engaged in their health.

**Pro Tip:** Providers are more likely to support your EndoGuard™-based interventions if you present them as collaborative questions rather than demands.

---

### Step 5: Stay Engaged

Hormone health is a journey, not a destination. Here's how to stay on track:

**Re-Assess Monthly.** Complete the symptom assessment once a month to track your progress. You'll see how your symptoms are changing over time and get updated recommendations.

**Explore the Knowledge Base.** Dive deeper into the science behind your recommendations. Understanding the "why" helps you stay motivated and make informed decisions.

**Join the Community.** Connect with other EndoGuard™ users who are on similar journeys. Share experiences, tips, and support.

**Reach Out for Help.** If you have questions or need support, our customer success team is here to help. Email support@endoguard.com or use the in-app chat.

**Pro Tip:** Consistency is the key to success. Regular tracking, monthly re-assessment, and steady implementation of recommendations drive the best outcomes.

---

### Common Questions

**Q: How accurate is the AI symptom analysis?**
The AI inference engine achieves 85% agreement with expert endocrinologist assessments in validation studies. However, it's a screening and educational tool, not a diagnostic tool. Always consult with a healthcare provider for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

**Q: Do I need lab results to use EndoGuard™?**
No. EndoGuard™ works with symptom data and exposure assessment alone. However, if you have hormone lab results, you can upload them for more personalized insights.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
Most users report noticeable symptom improvements within 30-90 days of implementing recommendations. Hormone changes take time, so patience and consistency are important.

**Q: What if I don't understand something in my results?**
Click on any term or recommendation for a detailed explanation. You can also search the knowledge base or contact support for help.

**Q: Can I share my results with friends or family?**
You can share general information about EndoGuard™, but your specific results are private and confidential. If you want to share your results with a healthcare provider, use the "Export Report" feature.

### Understanding Your Results

**Symptom Map**

The symptom map is a visual representation of how your symptoms connect to specific hormone pathways. Each pathway is represented by a node, and lines connect your symptoms to the pathways they may indicate.

**How to Read the Symptom Map:**
- **Larger nodes** indicate pathways with more symptom connections
- **Color coding** shows the strength of the connection (red = strong, yellow = moderate, green = weak)
- **Click on any node** to see detailed information about that hormone pathway
- **Click on any symptom** to see which pathways it connects to

**Common Pathways:**
- **HPT Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid):** Regulates metabolism, energy, temperature
- **HPA Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal):** Regulates stress response, cortisol
- **HPG Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal):** Regulates reproductive hormones (estrogen, testosterone)

**EDC Exposure Dashboard**

The EDC exposure dashboard shows your risk scores for major categories of endocrine disruptors. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater exposure risk.

**Risk Levels:**
- **0-25 (Green):** Low exposure
- **26-50 (Yellow):** Moderate exposure
- **51-75 (Orange):** High exposure
- **76-100 (Red):** Very high exposure

**Exposure Sources:**
For each EDC category, you'll see a breakdown of where your exposures are coming from. For example, if you have high BPA exposure, you might see: "Plastic food containers (40%), canned foods (30%), receipts (20%), other (10%)."

**Personalized Roadmap**

Your personalized roadmap is a prioritized list of evidence-based recommendations tailored to your symptoms and exposures. Recommendations are organized into categories:

- **Dietary Modifications:** Foods to add or avoid
- **Product Swaps:** Safer alternatives to high-EDC products
- **Lifestyle Interventions:** Sleep, stress, exercise recommendations
- **Supplement Guidance:** Evidence-based supplements (when appropriate)
- **Clinical Interventions:** When to seek medical care or testing

**How Recommendations Are Prioritized:**
1. **Potential Impact:** Based on strength of research evidence
2. **Feasibility:** How easy it is to implement
3. **Safety:** No contraindications or risks
4. **Synergies:** Works well with other recommendations

**Viewing Recommendation Details:**
Click on any recommendation to see:
- **Why it matters:** The science behind the recommendation
- **How to implement:** Step-by-step guidance
- **Expected outcomes:** What results to expect and when
- **Research citations:** Links to peer-reviewed studies
