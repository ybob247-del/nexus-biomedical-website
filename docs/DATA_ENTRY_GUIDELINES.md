# Data Entry Guidelines for Clinicians

**Quick Reference for Safe, HIPAA-Compliant Platform Use**

---

## Purpose

This document provides clear, practical examples of what information is safe to enter into Nexus Biomedical Intelligence platforms and what should be avoided. Following these guidelines ensures you can use our clinical decision support tools without creating HIPAA obligations or compromising patient privacy.

---

## Core Principle

**Never enter information that could directly identify a specific individual.**

Use pseudonyms, age ranges, and general descriptors that allow you to track cases and apply clinical insights while maintaining complete anonymity on our platform.

---

## Patient Identifiers

### ✅ SAFE: Pseudonyms and Case Codes

Use identifiers that are meaningful to you but do not reveal patient identity to anyone else.

| Safe Identifier | Why It Works | Example Use Case |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Initials + Number | Tracks multiple patients with same initials | "JS-001", "JS-002", "JS-003" |
| Case Number | Links to your internal tracking system | "Case 2024-045", "Endo-12" |
| Generic Label | Simple and completely anonymous | "Patient A", "Blue Case", "Theta-7" |
| Sequential ID | Easy to track chronologically | "Patient 001", "Patient 002" |
| Custom Code | Your own unique system | "Moon-23", "Star-15" |

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Patient MK-2024"
- ✅ "Endo Case 47"
- ✅ "RX-Check-089"
- ✅ "Case Alpha-12"

### ❌ UNSAFE: Real Names and Official IDs

Never use information that appears in official medical records or could be used to identify the patient.

| Unsafe Identifier | Why It's Problematic | Risk |
|-------------------|----------------------|------|
| Full Name | Direct identifier | "Jane Smith" - HIPAA violation |
| Medical Record Number (MRN) | Links to official records | "MRN 123456" - Creates BAA requirement |
| Social Security Number | Federal identifier | "SSN 123-45-6789" - Major privacy violation |
| Insurance Policy Number | Links to payer records | "Policy ABC123456" - HIPAA violation |
| Driver's License | State-issued ID | "DL X1234567" - PII violation |

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Jane Doe"
- ❌ "MRN 789456"
- ❌ "Patient SSN 123-45-6789"
- ❌ "Blue Cross Policy 987654"

---

## Age and Date of Birth

### ✅ SAFE: Age Ranges

Use 5-year age ranges that provide clinically relevant information without revealing exact dates of birth.

| Age Range | Clinical Utility | Example Entry |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| 18-25 | Young adult | "Age 20-25" or "Young adult (18-25)" |
| 25-30 | Reproductive age | "Age 25-30" |
| 30-35 | Early reproductive | "Age 30-35" |
| 35-40 | Mid reproductive | "Age 35-40" |
| 40-45 | Late reproductive | "Age 40-45" |
| 45-50 | Perimenopausal | "Age 45-50" |
| 50-55 | Early postmenopausal | "Age 50-55" |
| 55-60 | Postmenopausal | "Age 55-60" |
| 60-65 | Older adult | "Age 60-65" |
| 65+ | Senior | "Age 65+" or "Senior (65-70)" |

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Female, Age 35-40"
- ✅ "Male, 50-55 years old"
- ✅ "Age range: 45-50"

### ❌ UNSAFE: Exact Dates of Birth

Exact dates of birth are HIPAA identifiers and should never be entered.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "DOB: March 15, 1985"
- ❌ "Born 3/15/1985"
- ❌ "39 years old (DOB 1985)"
- ❌ "Birthday: 3/15"

---

## Demographics

### ✅ SAFE: General Categories

Use broad demographic categories that are clinically relevant.

| Category | Safe Entries | Examples |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Gender | Standard categories | "Female", "Male", "Non-binary", "Transgender female" |
| Ethnicity | Broad groups | "Hispanic/Latino", "White", "Black/African American", "Asian", "Native American" |
| Location | General region | "Southwest US", "Urban area", "Rural community", "Coastal region" |
| Occupation | General field | "Healthcare worker", "Office worker", "Manual labor", "Retired" |

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Hispanic female, Age 30-35, Urban area"
- ✅ "White male, Age 60-65, Retired"
- ✅ "Asian female, Age 25-30, Healthcare worker"

### ❌ UNSAFE: Specific Identifying Details

Avoid specific locations, employers, or unique characteristics that could identify the patient.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Lives at 123 Main Street, Springfield"
- ❌ "Works at Memorial Hospital, Cardiology Department"
- ❌ "Daughter of Dr. Smith"
- ❌ "Patient from small town of Centerville (population 500)"

## Clinical Information

### ✅ SAFE: General Medical Data

Enter symptoms, medications, and clinical findings in general terms without linking to specific records.

| Type | Safe Approach | Examples |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Medications | Generic or brand names with dosages | "Warfarin 5mg daily", "Metformin 1000mg BID" |
| Symptoms | Descriptive terms | "Irregular menstrual cycles", "Chronic pelvic pain" |
| Medical History | General conditions | "History of hypertension", "Previous endometriosis diagnosis" |
| Lab Values | Results without dates or facility | "Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL", "TSH 4.5 mIU/L" |
| Allergies | Drug names | "Penicillin allergy", "NKDA (no known drug allergies)" |

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Current medications: Lisinopril 10mg daily, Atorvastatin 20mg nightly"
- ✅ "Presenting symptoms: Heavy menstrual bleeding, fatigue, pelvic pressure"
- ✅ "Medical history: Type 2 diabetes (well-controlled), hypothyroidism"
- ✅ "Recent labs: HbA1c 6.8%, LDL 95 mg/dL"

### ❌ UNSAFE: Information Linked to Records

Avoid data that references specific dates, providers, facilities, or official records.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Seen by Dr. Johnson on 3/15/2024 at Memorial Hospital"
- ❌ "Labs drawn at Quest Diagnostics, order #789456"
- ❌ "Prescription filled at CVS Pharmacy on Main Street"
- ❌ "Admitted to ICU on 2/20/2024 for sepsis"
- ❌ "MRI scheduled for next Tuesday at Radiology Associates"

---

## Contact Information

### ✅ SAFE: No Contact Information Needed

Our platforms do not require patient contact information. Your account email is sufficient for all communications.

**What you should NOT enter:**
- Patient phone numbers
- Patient email addresses
- Patient home addresses
- Patient workplace contact information
- Emergency contact details

### ❌ UNSAFE: Any Patient Contact Details

Never enter any information that could be used to contact or locate the patient.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Phone: (555) 123-4567"
- ❌ "Email: patient@email.com"
- ❌ "Address: 123 Oak Street, Apt 4B"
- ❌ "Emergency contact: John Smith (husband) 555-987-6543"

---

## Assessment Responses

### ✅ SAFE: Self-Reported Information

Enter responses to platform assessment questions using the patient's self-reported information.

**RxGuard™ Medication Interaction Example:**

| Question | Safe Response | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Current medications? | "Warfarin 5mg daily, Aspirin 81mg daily, Omeprazole 20mg daily" | Drug names and dosages only |
| Over-the-counter supplements? | "Vitamin D 2000 IU, Fish oil 1000mg" | Generic product descriptions |
| Herbal products? | "St. John's Wort tea occasionally" | General descriptions |
| Recent medication changes? | "Started atorvastatin 2 months ago" | Relative timeframe, no specific dates |

**EndoGuard™ Hormone Assessment Example:**

| Question | Safe Response | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Menstrual cycle regularity? | "Irregular, cycles range 25-40 days" | Descriptive information |
| Pain severity? | "7/10 during menstruation, 3/10 between cycles" | Numeric scales |
| Previous diagnoses? | "Diagnosed with PCOS 5 years ago" | General timeframe |
| Family history? | "Mother had endometriosis" | Relationship without names |

### ❌ UNSAFE: Copied EHR Notes

Never copy and paste directly from electronic health records, as these often contain identifying information and timestamps.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Patient Jane Doe (MRN 123456) presented to clinic on 3/15/2024 with chief complaint of..."
- ❌ "Per Dr. Smith's note from last visit..."
- ❌ "Referral to Dr. Johnson at Women's Health Specialists scheduled for 4/1/2024"

## Special Situations

### Tracking the Same Patient Over Time

**Safe approach:**
- Use the same pseudonym for all assessments related to that patient
- Keep a secure record in your practice linking the pseudonym to the patient's real identity
- Add sequential numbers if needed: "Patient MK-001-Visit1", "Patient MK-001-Visit2"

**Example timeline:**
- ✅ Initial assessment: "Patient MK-2024-A, Female 35-40, Endo symptoms"
- ✅ Follow-up 3 months later: "Patient MK-2024-A, Follow-up assessment"
- ✅ Follow-up 6 months later: "Patient MK-2024-A, Post-treatment evaluation"

### Comparing Multiple Patients

**Safe approach:**
- Use distinct pseudonyms for each patient
- Create a comparison table in your own records linking pseudonyms to real identities
- Use consistent coding systems for easy tracking

**Example:**
- ✅ Patient Group A: "Endo-01", "Endo-02", "Endo-03" (all endometriosis cases)
- ✅ Patient Group B: "PCOS-01", "PCOS-02", "PCOS-03" (all PCOS cases)

### Research or Quality Improvement Projects

**Safe approach:**
- Assign study IDs that are completely separate from medical record numbers
- Use your IRB-approved coding system
- Maintain the link between study IDs and patient identities in a secure, separate location

**Example:**
- ✅ "Study ID: ENDO-2024-001, Female 30-35, Treatment Group A"
- ✅ "QI Project Case 12, Male 55-60, Intervention Group"
