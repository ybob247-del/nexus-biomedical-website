## Problem Statement Section

### Headline
**The Silent Epidemic Affecting Your Hormones**

### Body Copy

Millions of people suffer from unexplained fatigue, weight changes, mood swings, irregular periods, fertility issues, and declining testosterone—yet conventional medicine often misses the root cause. The truth is, your hormones are under attack from an invisible threat: **endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)** in everyday products.

Microplastics, BPA, phthalates, and dozens of other chemicals have infiltrated our food, water, personal care products, and homes. These substances mimic, block, or interfere with your natural hormones, creating a cascade of health issues that doctors aren't trained to recognize or address.

**The problem isn't just in your head. It's in your environment.**

### Statistics Callout Boxes

## FAQ Section

### Headline
**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Is EndoGuard™ a replacement for medical care?**
A: No. EndoGuard™ is a health intelligence platform designed to complement, not replace, medical care. We provide information and insights to help you make informed decisions and communicate more effectively with your healthcare providers. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.

**Q: How accurate is the AI symptom analysis?**
A: Our AI inference engine achieves 85% agreement with expert endocrinologist assessments in validation studies. However, it's a screening and educational tool, not a diagnostic tool. Results should be discussed with a healthcare provider for clinical interpretation.

**Q: Do I need lab results to use EndoGuard™?**
A: No. EndoGuard™ works with symptom data and exposure assessment alone. However, if you have hormone lab results, you can upload them for more personalized insights.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: Most users report noticeable symptom improvements within 30-90 days of implementing recommendations. Hormone changes take time, so patience and consistency are important. Our tracking tools help you monitor progress objectively.

**Q: Is my data private and secure?**
A: Absolutely. EndoGuard™ is HIPAA compliant and uses bank-level encryption (AES-256). Your data is never sold to third parties. You can export or delete your data at any time. We take privacy and security extremely seriously.

**Q: What makes EndoGuard™ different from other health apps?**
A: EndoGuard™ is the only platform that combines comprehensive EDC exposure assessment, clinical-grade evidence (every insight traceable to peer-reviewed research), and AI-powered personalization—all in one solution. We focus specifically on the environmental factors affecting hormone health, which no other platform addresses.

**Q: Can I share my results with my doctor?**
A: Yes! You can export comprehensive PDF reports to bring to appointments. Many healthcare providers find EndoGuard™ assessments helpful for understanding patient concerns and guiding treatment decisions.

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**
A: Yes. We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for Premium subscriptions. If you're not satisfied, contact us within 30 days of purchase for a full refund.

**Q: Is EndoGuard™ available internationally?**
A: Currently, EndoGuard™ is optimized for users in the United States. We're planning international expansion in 2026, starting with the UK, EU, Australia, and Canada.
