## The Problem

Medical providers and patients face **crushing hormone health complexity**: navigating PCOS, thyroid disorders, menopause, and male hormone optimization while environmental endocrine disruptors silently undermine treatment outcomes costs the healthcare system **$50B+ annually** in the United States alone.

- **20M Americans** affected by thyroid disorders, many undiagnosed
- **1 in 10 women** suffer from PCOS with limited treatment options
- **50% decline** in male fertility over the past 40 years
- **Microplastics, BPA, phthalates** disrupting hormones at population scale
- Traditional symptom tracking apps miss **critical environmental exposures**

**The result?** Patients dismissed by providers, expensive specialist consultations with 3-6 month wait times, and confusing lab results with no actionable guidance.
