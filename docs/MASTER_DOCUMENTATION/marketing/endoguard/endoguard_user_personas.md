## Primary User Segments

### 1. Women with Hormone Imbalances (Ages 25-55)

**Demographics:**
Women aged 25-55 experiencing symptoms of hormonal dysregulation including irregular periods, PCOS, thyroid disorders, perimenopause symptoms, unexplained weight changes, mood disturbances, fertility challenges, and chronic fatigue. This segment represents the largest user base, estimated at 60-70% of total users.

**Psychographic Profile:**
These users are proactive about their health, frustrated by dismissive medical experiences, and seeking answers that conventional healthcare has failed to provide. They are digitally literate, research-oriented, and willing to invest in tools that offer genuine insights. Many have spent years navigating a fragmented healthcare system, receiving conflicting advice, and struggling to connect their symptoms to underlying hormonal causes.

**Pain Points:**
- Symptoms dismissed or attributed to stress, anxiety, or "just being a woman"
- Multiple specialists with no coordination or holistic view
- Limited understanding of how environmental factors (microplastics, EDCs, diet, stress) affect hormones
- Difficulty tracking complex symptom patterns over time
- Lack of personalized, evidence-based guidance
- Frustration with trial-and-error approach to treatment
- Financial burden of repeated tests and ineffective treatments

**Goals and Needs:**
- Understand the root causes of their symptoms
- Identify environmental and lifestyle factors contributing to hormone imbalances
- Track symptoms and correlate them with hormone patterns
- Receive evidence-based recommendations for diet, lifestyle, and clinical interventions
- Communicate more effectively with healthcare providers using data

**How EndoGuard™ Serves Them:**
EndoGuard™ provides a comprehensive hormone intelligence platform that maps symptoms to endocrine pathways using AI-driven inference. The Endocrine Disruptor Exposure Assessment helps users identify hidden sources of EDCs in their environment—from personal care products to food packaging to household items. The Clinical Evidence Engine ensures every recommendation is traceable to peer-reviewed research, empowering users to advocate for themselves in clinical settings. The Personalized Hormone Health Roadmap offers actionable steps tailored to individual profiles, while longitudinal tracking reveals patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

**Use Cases:**
- A 32-year-old woman with PCOS uses EndoGuard™ to identify that her daily use of plastic water bottles and conventional cosmetics may be contributing to her insulin resistance and hormonal acne
- A 45-year-old experiencing irregular periods and mood swings discovers through the platform that her symptoms align with perimenopause exacerbated by environmental estrogen exposure from her work environment
- A 28-year-old struggling with fertility tracks her symptoms and environmental exposures, then shares the EndoGuard™ report with her reproductive endocrinologist to inform treatment decisions

**How EndoGuard™ Serves Them:**
EndoGuard™ addresses the often-overlooked area of male hormone health with the same rigor applied to women's health. The platform helps men identify environmental exposures (phthalates in personal care products, BPA in food containers, pesticides in diet) that may be suppressing testosterone production. The Clinical Evidence Engine provides research-backed insights on natural interventions, lifestyle modifications, and when medical intervention may be appropriate. The discrete, app-based interface allows men to track symptoms and progress privately.

**Use Cases:**
- A 42-year-old executive experiencing fatigue and low libido discovers through EndoGuard™ that his daily use of plastic food containers and conventional grooming products may be contributing to declining testosterone
- A 35-year-old couple struggling with infertility uses the platform to assess the male partner's exposure to EDCs in his workplace (manufacturing environment) and makes targeted changes that improve sperm quality
