### What This Means:
- You DON'T need to provide patient names
- You DON'T need to upload medical records
- You DON'T need to share diagnosis codes

- We provide educational insights, not medical diagnoses

**Important Clarification:**

Nexus Biomedical Intelligence is **NOT** a covered entity or business associate under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Here's why:

### What We DON'T Do (HIPAA Requirements):

- **No PHI/PII Collection:** We do NOT collect protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII) as defined by HIPAA

- **No Medical Records:** We do NOT store, transmit, or process medical records or clinical documentation
- **No Identifiable Health Data:** We do NOT link health assessments to real patient identities, medical record numbers, or social security numbers

### What We Actually Do:

- Users create accounts with email addresses (not linked to medical records)
- Users answer health questions anonymously (self-reported data)
- We provide educational insights and risk assessments (not diagnoses)
- All data is pseudonymous and cannot be traced back to medical records

**Our platforms are educational tools and clinical decision support systems, NOT medical record systems or HIPAA-covered services.**
