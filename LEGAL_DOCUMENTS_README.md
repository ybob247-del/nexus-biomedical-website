## Key Legal Points for Review

### 1. HIPAA Compliance Status
**Critical Question:** Have we correctly characterized our HIPAA status as "not a covered entity"?

The documents state we are NOT HIPAA-covered because:
- We don't provide medical treatment, diagnosis, or prescriptions
- We're not a health insurance plan
- We don't process insurance claims
- We don't transmit PHI on behalf of providers
- We don't access EHRs

**Request:** Verify this characterization is legally accurate for our business model.

### 2. Medical Disclaimers
**Critical Question:** Are our medical disclaimers sufficient to protect against liability?

The documents include disclaimers that:
- Services are for informational/educational purposes only
- We don't provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment
- Users should consult healthcare professionals
- We're not responsible for medical outcomes

**Request:** Verify disclaimers are adequate and properly positioned.

### 3. Data Collection and Privacy
**Critical Question:** Are our data collection practices properly disclosed?

We collect:
- Email, password, account info
- Self-reported health information (voluntarily entered)
- Medication names for interaction checking
- Assessment responses and results

We do NOT collect:
- Patient names or medical record numbers
- Social Security numbers
- Insurance information
- Medical records from providers
- EHR data

**Request:** Verify privacy disclosures are complete and compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws.

### 4. Healthcare Provider Use
**Critical Question:** Have we properly addressed healthcare provider concerns about HIPAA liability?

The documents state:
- Providers using our tools don't create HIPAA liability
- No BAA (Business Associate Agreement) needed
- Providers responsible for de-identifying any patient data they enter
- Recommend using tools for educational purposes or with anonymized data

**Request:** Verify this guidance is legally sound and protects both the company and healthcare providers.

### 5. Limitations of Liability
**Critical Question:** Are our liability limitations enforceable?

The Terms include:
- "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" disclaimers
- Limitations on consequential damages
- Cap on total liability ($100 or amount paid in last 12 months)

**Request:** Verify these limitations are enforceable in relevant jurisdictions.

### 6. Subscription and Refund Policies
**Critical Question:** Are our payment terms clear and legally compliant?

The Terms state:
- Monthly subscriptions with automatic renewal
- No refunds for partial periods
- Cancellation takes effect at end of billing period

**Request:** Verify these terms comply with consumer protection laws and payment processing regulations.
