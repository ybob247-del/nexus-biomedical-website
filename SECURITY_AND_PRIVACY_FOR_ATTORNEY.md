# Security & Privacy

## Understanding HIPAA and Our Services

**Nexus Biomedical Intelligence is not a HIPAA-covered entity.**

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies to three types of organizations:

1. **Healthcare Providers** who transmit health information electronically in connection with certain transactions (such as billing)
2. **Health Plans** (insurance companies, HMOs, Medicare, Medicaid)
3. **Healthcare Clearinghouses** that process health information between providers and payers

We do not fall into any of these categories. We are an **educational technology platform** providing health information and clinical decision support tools. We do not provide medical treatment, process insurance claims, or operate as a healthcare clearinghouse.

**This means healthcare providers using our Services do not need a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with us, and using our platforms does not create HIPAA liability for their practices.**

## Our Commitment to Security
