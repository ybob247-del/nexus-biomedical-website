## Important Notes

### Test Mode vs Live Mode
- Create these links in **TEST MODE** first for testing
- When ready to accept real customers, create the same links in **LIVE MODE**
- Test mode URLs contain `/test_` in the URL

### Free Trial Best Practices
- All trials require credit card upfront (industry standard)
- This reduces fraud and increases conversion rates
- Customers are NOT charged during the trial period
- They can cancel anytime before trial ends

### Tax Collection
- Stripe automatically calculates and collects sales tax based on customer location
- You don't need to configure anything - it's automatic

### Customer Information
- We only collect customer names (not business names or addresses)
- This reduces friction and increases conversion rates
- For Enterprise customers, you'll collect additional info via email

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I edit a payment link after creating it?**  
A: No, Stripe payment links cannot be edited. You must create a new link with the correct information.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**  
A: Simply create a new payment link with the correct information and delete the incorrect one.

**Q: How do I switch from test mode to live mode?**  
A: Use the toggle switch in the top-right corner of your Stripe Dashboard.

**Q: Can customers pay annually instead of monthly?**  
A: Not with these payment links. For annual billing, contact customers directly and create custom invoices.
