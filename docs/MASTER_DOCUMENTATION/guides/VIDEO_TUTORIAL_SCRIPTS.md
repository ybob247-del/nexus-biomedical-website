**Narration:** "EndoGuard™ combines artificial intelligence with evidence-based medicine to evaluate your exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, or EDCs. These are substances found in plastics, personal care products, food packaging, and even drinking water that can interfere with your body's hormone systems. Our platform analyzes symptoms across four major hormone systems: thyroid function, reproductive health, adrenal response, and metabolic regulation."

**On-screen text:** 
- "Thyroid Function"

*Visual: Screen recording of demographics form being filled out*

**Narration:** "The first step asks for basic demographic information. Enter your age range and biological sex. This information helps our AI algorithm provide more accurate risk assessments, as hormone health varies significantly by age and sex. For example, perimenopausal women face different hormone challenges than men in their twenties. All information is kept strictly confidential and is never shared with third parties."

**On-screen text:** "Step 1 of 6: Demographics"

**[02:00-03:00] Step 2: Symptoms**

*Visual: Screen recording of symptom selection interface*

For thyroid symptoms, you might select fatigue, weight changes, or temperature sensitivity. For reproductive health, options include irregular periods, low libido, or fertility concerns. For adrenal function, look for chronic stress, sleep disturbances, or anxiety. And for metabolic health, consider insulin resistance, difficulty losing weight, or blood sugar fluctuations. Select all symptoms that apply to you. The more accurate your input, the more personalized your results will be."

**On-screen text:** 
- "Thyroid: Fatigue, weight changes, temperature sensitivity"
- "Reproductive: Irregular periods, low libido, fertility issues"

Then, you'll indicate your exposure to common EDC sources like plastic food containers, non-stick cookware, conventional personal care products, and tap water. These questions help identify where you might be encountering endocrine disruptors in your daily life. Don't worry if you're not sure about some answers—just provide your best estimate."

**On-screen text:** "Steps 3-5: Lifestyle & EDC Exposure"

**Narration:** "The final step lets you review all your answers before submitting. Take a moment to ensure everything is accurate. When you're ready, click the 'Complete Assessment' button. Our AI algorithm will analyze your responses using a sophisticated five-domain weighted scoring system that evaluates symptom count and type, symptom duration, stress levels, lifestyle factors, and EDC exposure patterns."

**On-screen text:** "Review Your Answers → Complete Assessment"
